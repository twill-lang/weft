# Changelog

Every entry below is a commit in this repository. Nothing is listed that I
cannot point at.

## Unreleased

Eighteen commits since `v0.1.0`, all of them either following twill's releases
or fixing what following them exposed.

### Take twill 1.13.0

twill 1.13.0 is released, so the pin follows it. `spool.toml`, CI and the
README install line move from 1.12.0 to 1.13.0. The compile floor stays 1.12.0,
because the tuple returns this code relies on arrived there and nothing newer is
used; the pin sits one release ahead of the floor, and the spool comment says
so. No source or test changed and the six suites pass unchanged on 1.13.0.

### The glyph tables are `const`, and a low and a high come back as a tuple

`docs/needs.md` entries 9 and 13 were open and twill had delivered both. `HEX`,
`QUADRANTS`, `DENSITY` and `LEVELS`, with the two ASCII fallbacks, are declared
`const` (twill 1.10), so an assignment through any of them in its own file is
refused by the checker. The guarantee does not yet cross an import, and the
needs entry says so rather than claiming more.

`pad_degenerate` and `range_of` return `(F64, F64)` (twill 1.12) and their
callers destructure the pair. The `Span` and `Range` structs are gone; they were
two of the four single-use type names entry 13 complained about. The heatmap
functions that took a `Range` take `lo` and `hi`.

The compile floor is twill 1.12.0, which is what `spool.toml`, CI and the README
recorded at this point; the pin later followed the release past it, above. The
six suites pass unchanged, which is the point: nothing a test could see moved.

### The minimum twill is now 1.7.0, and it is load-bearing

`src/theme.tw:33` and `src/svg.tw:35` dispatch the palette index on integer
literals in `match` arms. A literal in a pattern position arrived in 1.7.0;
before it a pattern was a case name and at most one binder. Under 1.6.7 the
suite gives 3 passed and 3 failed, all three of them that one construct:

```
line 22: in import "theme.tw": line 33:5: expected identifier but found "0"
line 4: in import "../src/svg.tw": line 35:5: expected identifier but found "0"
```

Moving onto 1.7 did not by itself raise the floor: the suite passed unchanged on
1.7 the day CI was pinned to it. The dispatch rewrite that came after is what
made 1.7 required.

### It runs

- The 6 suites under `tests/` pass. `twill test tests` under 1.7.1 reports
  `6 file(s): 6 passed, 0 failed`, and CI runs that rather than a hand-kept list
  of files.
- `twill run examples/loss.tw` exits 0. CI runs the examples as well as checking
  them, because `twill check` follows imports for enum declarations only and
  cannot see a call into another module whose signature changed.
- `examples/loss.tw` no longer calls `main()` itself. `twill run` executes a
  systems-mode file's top level and then calls `main()`, which it has done since
  1.6.1, so the example was training the model and drawing the curve twice.
- CI checks every `.tw` file in the repository rather than the three directories
  `src tests examples`.

### twill's terminal code stopped being a vendored path

`src/term/caps`, `ansi`, `width`, `box` and `frame` are `std/term/...` now and
are compiled into the binary. Every import that used to reach into
`../twill_modules/twill/src/term/` is a `std/` import, and a working checkout
has no `twill_modules/` directory. That was entry 11 in `docs/needs.md`.

### Types, from following 1.5 and 1.6

- `RES_BRAILLE/RES_BLOCK/RES_ASCII` became `enum Resolution { Braille, Block,
  Ascii }` and `MARK_LINE/MARK_DOT` became `enum Mark { Line, Dot }`. Six
  dispatch sites are exhaustive matches; each had ended in an `else` that
  silently meant ASCII, or a dot.
- `push_now` was added beside `live.push`, on `mono_ns` rather than a wall
  clock. `push` keeps taking the time as a parameter, because a plot whose test
  cannot control its clock has no test.
- `live_test` stopped taking twenty minutes.
- The 1.5 sweep found arithmetic that was quietly wrong: integer division
  written as `/`, which returned a float and made counts, indices and loop
  bounds fractional, and `not(x)` where the bitwise `bnot(x)` was meant.

### Prose

- Repository URLs and the module path point at the `twill-lang` org.
- `docs/needs.md` records which entries twill delivered and which are open,
  against 1.7.1 rather than against a guess.
- The README's status table names the test or example that exercises each piece,
  and says so where nothing does: heatmaps and `Mark.Dot` scatter run but are
  untested.

## v0.1.0 (2026-08-15)

Ported to twill 1.5. The library was written before `mode systems` could run it,
so this tag is the source and the design, not a working release.
